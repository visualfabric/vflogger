# How to Contribute

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide

Here are some resources, from the team at Github, to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

While these articles specifically refer to Github, most of it is generic enough to be applicable for any other git hosting environment.

## Getting Started

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md).

Check to see what [types of contributions](types-of-contributions.md) we accept before making changes.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new one using a relevant issue form.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.


### Make Changes

1. Install Git. You can go with the command line client or any of its desktop variant.

2. Fork the repository, so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

3. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit Your Update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Once your changes are ready, don't forget to [self-review](self-review.md) to speed up the review process.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.

- Don't forget to link PR to issue, if you are solving one.

- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.

Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.

- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can make these changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.

- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.

- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on this repository. 

Now that you are part of our community, see how else you can [contribute](types-of-contributions.md).
