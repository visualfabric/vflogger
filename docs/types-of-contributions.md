## Issues

Issues are used to track tasks that contributors can help with. Do not begin work work on an issue unless it is triaged from our end.

If you are facing errors've found something in the source code or the website that should be fixed, search open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing. If it's something new, open an issue using a template. We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

## Documentation

No code is complete without documentation. Unfortunately, in most of the cases, the available documenation is not enough. Contributions are always welcome, so that others may benefit from your insight and/or expertise.
